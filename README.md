# refrigeratoreye
program for A standalone device which is outside the refrigerator or it can be built in the refrigerator while manufacturing. It recognizes each food type that enters it, stores its weight and expiring date and display its nutrition information. It suggests recipes according to the food products stored. When a food product is expired or insufficient, the user receives a mobile application notification of it and a suggested shopping list of the food products that are about to run out. The smart system predicts probable errors and notifies the user to change its parameter (temperature, distance from the wall, â€¦etc.) to prevent performance problems.
